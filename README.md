<h1 align="center">Custom-Task-Manager</h1>


This is my first full CRUD web application built with Flask and SQLite.
I created it as part of my learning journey to understand how to structure real projects, connect a database, and build something practical that I can use.

The goal of this project was simple:

ðŸ‘‰ Learn how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in a real app.


## ðŸš€ Features

 - Add new tasks with deadlines
 - Organize tasks by categories
 - Edit and update tasks anytime
 - Mark tasks as completed
 - Delete tasks or categories
 - Simple, clean UI with custom CSS
